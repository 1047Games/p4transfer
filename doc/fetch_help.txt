NAME:
    FetchTransfer.py

DESCRIPTION:
    This python script (2.7/3.6+ compatible) will transfer Perforce changelists with all contents
    between independent servers using p4 fetch with a remote spec.

    This script transfers changes in one direction - from a source server to a target server.

    Usage:

        python3 FetchTransfer.py -h

    The script requires a config file, by default transfer.yaml,
    that provides the Perforce connection information for both servers.

    An initial example can be generated, e.g.

        FetchTransfer.py --sample-config > transfer.yaml

    For full documentation/usage, see project doc:
